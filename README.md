## About

Yap2Type is a cutting-edge tool made to assist users in summarizing audio-based content such as news, podcasts, conferences, and conversations. Users can record or upload audio files to the application, and artificial intelligence is used to distill the content into clear, short bullet points. Users can save time and effort by using Yap2Type to rapidly obtain an overview of conversations or discussions without having to listen to the full recording again.
